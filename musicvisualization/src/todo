TODO::

1. (DONE) Set the modulo factor on the Trip such that we have a attenuation

light in 0 -> 255

maps to light * ( 255 - light) / 63.75
Note that we have the maxima around 127.5, and minimas around light = 0 and 
light = 255. 

This will enable some neat smoothing


apply after we get the byte values (otherwise no interference)

1.5 (DONE) Add in functionality to control the rate, etc of the visualization
use to find relationship

2. Be able to zoom in -- remove factors based on screen size
	a. Zoom by manually changing values
	b. Enable gesture zoom

Keep track of x y pos, and be able to zoom in wrt that. Have floating point
numbers for where we are.

3. (DONE) Be able to have additional parameters in the function
Having an interference pattern wrt music would be pretty cool, esp as it moves
outwards.

4. Add in tonal based on the tempo, tone of the note played. 
Have a chain of 'if' statements that determines the hue of the note.
