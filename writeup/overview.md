# Documentation Overview
We have three files that you should look at, 
1. _project/project.pdf_
   This file describes the project, what technoligies  
   were used, and how they were put together. We also  
   discuss the challenges we came across while  
   creating the project, and the testing methods utilized  
2. _visualization-algo/visualization-algo.pdf_
   In this document we discuss the look of the visualization,  
   and the underlying function and controller for making  
   the visualization in sync with the music.

   We also discuss the mathematics behind the algorithm,  
   and why we get certain patterns or interesting behavior  
   from our algorithm.  

   In this folder we include several screenshots which  
   can be viewed up close. These are included in the pdf. 
3. _music-generation/music-generation.pdf_
   This document discusses the general algorithm that  
   we used to generate music, then the modifications  
   that we made to make the music sound more interesing  
   or similar to music.

   We also discuss the qualitative properties of the sound  
   we're generating and how that is linked to the  
   algorithm we are using.  

   We discuss the MIDI format, and how we process the MIDI
   data to be reasoned with in a high level manner.
