idea :

what we need -- the ability to modify different variables

each row represents the modification of a single variable
we have 2 types of rows -- an enum row, 
and a value row. When the # of rows grows too large, it begins
to scroll vertically. 

enum row : Two columns, the JLabel title, then a JDropDownMenu.
JDropDownMenu -- we select an individual item.
Also we use it for boolean settings, mapping it ON or OFF

value row: Three columns -- 

first column : JLabel for the name of the variable
second column : 
  Top -- a JTextBox which modifies the total +- range 
         of the slider 
  Bottom -- JSlider that modifies the value. Has at most 
         Current value + Top's value, and
         Current value - Top's value.

third column : JTextBox which displays (and you can modify) the 
value of the item

-----

variables we want to control --

   enum 	-- smoothing type
   double 	-- cc value
   double 	-- exp value
   boolean 	-- darken or not
   
on the display itself -- 
   zoom using trackpad
   use trackpad for scrolling 


----

Using these, we can explore sequences that are interesting

Map out a series of sequences that provide an interesting pattern -- write out bpm per cc, and what it means fractionally
Map out dot spacing per cc, what the relationship is.
